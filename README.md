This is a Recipe Box, built using ReactJS and Twitter Bootstrap.

As a user I can :
1/ Create recipes that have names and ingredients.

2/ See an index view where the names of all the recipes are visible.

3/ Click into any of those recipes to view it.

4/ Edit these recipes.

5/ Delete these recipes.

6/ All new recipes I add are saved in my browser's local storage.
If I refresh the page, these recipes will still be there.
